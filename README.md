[CASE 2 ] VDI-Challenge media.tar.bz2

Bobby-1337 is an Interpol fugitive who used to work as a hitman. Long story short, he was captured through a CIA intelligence joint operation after a mysterious murder case of CEO Evil Corps A.ka Mr. Pedros Ledezma was revealed. Bobby was arrested in his apartment at St. Bleckley Ave. 10, Atlanta before trying to escape to Haiti. The electronic proof obtained is a flasdisk that contains only an Image File (Vdi). Abbie is a DFIR Investigator in this case and he managed to get something suspicious in the /home directory because the folder was encrypted. Can you help Abbie to solve this case.


Hint: 
This task includes disk forensics, memory forensics and basic crypto tasks.

Good luck!
